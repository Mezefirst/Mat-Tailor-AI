# Production Deployment Features

This document outlines the production-ready features implemented in MatTailor AI.

## üîí Security Features

### CORS Protection
- Configurable allowed origins via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
- Supports JSON array or comma-separated format
- Restricts access to authorized domains only

### Rate Limiting  
- API endpoint rate limiting using `slowapi`
- Different limits for different endpoint types
- Nginx-level rate limiting for additional protection

### Error Handling
- Sanitized error responses that don't leak sensitive information
- Structured logging for security monitoring
- No stack traces or API keys in error responses

### HTTPS Configuration
- Automatic SSL certificate setup with Let's Encrypt
- HSTS headers for enhanced security
- Secure cookie handling and CSP headers

## üîå Third-Party Integrations

### Supported Data Sources
- **MatWeb**: Material property database integration
- **Materials Project**: Computational materials database
- Secure API key management via environment variables

### Configuration
Add API keys to your environment:
```bash
MATWEB_API_KEY=your-matweb-api-key
MATERIALS_PROJECT_API_KEY=your-materials-project-key
```

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Health Checks
- `/health` endpoint for basic health monitoring
- Database connectivity checks
- Service status reporting

### Metrics Collection
- Prometheus integration for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- API performance monitoring

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging format
- Rate limit violation tracking
- Security event logging

## üöÄ Deployment Options

### Docker Production Stack
- Full production stack with `docker-compose.prod.yml`
- Includes PostgreSQL, Redis, Nginx, monitoring
- Automated SSL certificate management

### Cloud Platforms
- Railway/Heroku ready configuration
- Vercel/Netlify frontend deployment
- Environment-based configuration

## üîß Configuration Management

### Environment Variables
- Template provided in `backend/.env.example`
- Production vs development configurations
- Secure secret management

### Domain Configuration
- `FRONTEND_URL` and `BACKEND_URL` for proper routing
- CORS configuration for multiple domains
- SSL certificate setup for subdomains

## üìà Performance Features

### Caching
- Redis integration for API response caching
- Database query optimization
- Static asset caching via Nginx

### Database
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Automated migrations via SQL scripts
- Performance monitoring and indexing

### Rate Limiting
```
/recommend: 30 req/min    # AI recommendations
/tradeoff: 20 req/min     # Complex analysis
/simulate: 20 req/min     # Property simulation  
/search: 60 req/min       # Material search
/health: 200 req/min      # Health checks
```

## üõ† Maintenance Tools

### Deployment Scripts
- `scripts/deploy.sh` - Automated production deployment
- `scripts/setup-ssl.sh` - SSL certificate setup
- `scripts/test-deployment.py` - Configuration validation

### Monitoring
- Grafana dashboard at `https://monitoring.your-domain.com`
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Automated alerting capabilities

## üîê Security Compliance

### Data Protection
- API keys stored as environment variables
- No sensitive data in version control
- Proper data licensing compliance for third-party sources

### Access Control
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- CORS restrictions for authorized domains
- Basic authentication for monitoring interfaces

This production setup ensures MatTailor AI is secure, scalable, and ready for enterprise deployment.
